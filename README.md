# Impact analysis

Original version of code is lost (laptop damage + didn't push the code). This version of the draft works well and produces the same results as in the paper. 

# TODO: 
- add tests
- rewrite the old draft

**NB** : Files that look like: `parameters_proces_energy.dat` are needed to avoid double fitting.
